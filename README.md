## Getting Started
The process of setting up your Jetson Nano to automatically run a Python script on startup is made easy with the step-by-step guide provided in this repository. You'll learn how to create and configure a systemd service that manages the execution of your script. This eliminates the need to manually start your script each time the system boots up, enhancing the efficiency of your workflow.

## Example
To demonstrate the setup process, we've included a detailed example in the repository. This example walks you through configuring the systemd service for a hypothetical script named `button.py`. You'll see how to specify the script's path, working directory, and other essential settings to ensure reliable execution during startup.

## Usage
1. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the [Getting Started](#getting-started) section to set up the systemd service for your Python script.
2. Customize the service file with your script's details, working directory, and user information.
3. Enable the service to make it run on startup and start the service to test its functionality.
4. Refer to the [Contributing](#contributing) section if you'd like to contribute improvements or fixes to this guide.
